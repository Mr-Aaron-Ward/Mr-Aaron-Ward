## Citations

I tried and found multiple different ways and commands that you could use to navigate the command prompt. Like to create a new directory, google AI said to do 
this, "New-Item -Path "C:\" -Name "MyData" -ItemType directory". While ChatGPT said to use do this, mkdir "Dir B". I did get both to work after I put the correct location for the -Path. For returning to the home directory, google AI said to do, cd ~. While chatGPT said to do, Set-Location ~. Both did work. This lead me to figure out that cd and Set-Location are the same. Along with the other commands listed above.
